# daypercentage

This program calculates the amount of day that has passed in percentages. It takes a start and an end hour as input (in 12-hour format), if no input is given, "6am 10pm" is the default input. If the day has passed beyond the end hour, the program returns the amount that has passed since end until the start, in negative percentages.
