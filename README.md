# daypercentage

This program calculates the amount of day that has passed in percentages. It takes a start and an end hour as input (in 12-hour format), if no input is given, "-s 6AM -e 10PM" is the default input. If the day has passed beyond the end hour, the program returns the amount that has passed since end until the start, in negative percentages.
